      <p>
        Food is good; we can all agree on that. But whatâ€™s better than just 
        uploading sensual photos of delectable food is inscribing fitting
        captions on them? This, my friend, is the purpose of this listing.

      <p>
        People nowadays love taking pictures of their food. Some post them
        online, some save them for remembrance, and some keep them for the
        aesthetics.
